# Misc

Most weapons from clones/echoes (ie Luigi, Daisy) can't be cloned
Mario Fireball needs a "speed" parameter when cloned. It will always use this parameter's value for speed during the first status (lowkey Miiswordfighter Wave (from his final smash) could be more useful)
Peach's Toad can be cloned, this also has a flip.prc which makes it great for models
